[31mLEGACY MODES ENABLED:[39m
 This application uses the legacy initial residual evaluation behavior. The legacy behavior performs an often times redundant residual evaluation before the solution modifying objects are executed prior to the initial (0th nonlinear iteration) residual evaluation. The new behavior skips that redundant residual evaluation unless the parameter Executioner/use_pre_smo_residual is set to true. To remove this message and enable the new behavior, set the parameter 'use_legacy_initial_residual_evaluation_behavior' to false in *App.C. Some tests that rely on the side effects of the legacy behavior may fail/diff and should be re-golded.
